== Read more code

[.notes]
--
* As in eat more fruits.
* Reading more prepares you for future problems, gives ideas.
* You will see the solution and do not have to search for it.
* a method/class/package a day keeps the guru away.

=== The importance of reading code.

[quote, Martin Fowler, Refactoring]
Any fool can write code that a computer understands. +
Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

[.notes]
--
* A program is a story by one human to another with the side-effect that a computer can execute it.
* Visit code exhibits (good example open source).
* Mind the naming problem. Good type (class) and method names are beneficial to readability.

=== Collect good examples

[.notes]
--
* even home brew, if they can withstand some scrutiny.
* Make reading (good) code part of the homework. (For teachers, code reviewers).

=== Study good examples

* Give students code to read, for instance as a context.
* Fill in the blanks exercises help here.


[.notes]
--
* Reading a lot makes a better writer, also for code.
* Adding review exercises, e.g. comparing solutions for e.g. readability, testability,
  can help.
* The parts around the blanks need to be understood, and when that is beautiful code,
  the student gets the exposure you want.

=== Not just writing code

* Coding is not only writing statements.
* It is studying how elements can be combined: reading.
* Write your own API doc.
* And don't forget: API doc is *what* it does, not how.
* API doc can and should be brief.

[.notes]
--
* Reading API doc, is also about homework.
* Good code is understandable code, by virtue of the names used and the easy to understand constructs.
* add reviewing code as a skill.

=== It's about Quality

* A green test is not the only quality; +
 [blue]#Readability# is more important.
* Code duplication by copy and waste makes a [red]#boring# read.
* Review often, because functional testing is blind for writing style.
* Readable code is correct most of the time.

[.notes]
--
* Another reason to avoid *code duplication or copy and waste*: all that copied code has to be read too, which is
  both boring and a waste of reading time.
* And since it is a boring read, copy and waste landfills are an excellent place for bugs to hide.
* Review code, in particular or readability, not just on functional correctness.
