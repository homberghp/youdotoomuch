== Test More

* Testing is not a [red]*cost* but an [green]*investment*.
* By working TDD style you typically write [green]#less# code.
* Writing tests can help [green]#reveal inconsistencies# in requirements.
* You [green]#reduce risk# in the future.
* Having [red]#to few# tests produces a serious [red]#technical debt#.

[.notes]
--
* Studies have shown that, after some decrease at the beginning, +
  testing actually increases programmers productivity.
* In coding, _less is more_.
* Automated tests and regressions.
* If your company is also hired for maintenance, the investment will pay out double.
* Testing makes code more easily transferable.

=== No Tests, No Progress

* You can't measure progress [green]#unless# you test.
* A test ensures that a feature is realized.

[.notes]
--
Although tests can't prove the absence of errors,
they can help measure the degree of done.

=== Tests give confidence

* Including confidence to change or experiment.

[.notes]
--
* a set of passing functional tests are a great way to enable experiments
  to improve non functional aspects such as efficiency, readability.

=== Testing Documents

* A well written test is the easiest way to document how an API +
 is to be used, including [red]*pre*- and post-conditions.

[.notes]
--
* Tests are an excellent way to document the use of an API.
* A (unit) test can help express the intend of the (original) developer.

=== Example

[source,java]
----
  String greet= greeter.greet( "Klaas" );
  assertThat(greet) // passes iff
      .isNotNull() // prevents NPE down the chain
      .isNotEmpty() // not really needed
      .contains( "Hello", "Klaas" );

[.notes]
--
* Apply the same rules to tests as to normal code, like style, readability.
* Using a modern test framework (e.g. AssertJ) helps creating *readable* tests.
* The test is trivial to write and exposes the function of the API.
* Example uses more asserts than needed, but is about readability.

=== Example error handling

[source,java]
----
  ThrowingCallable code = () -> {
          greeter.greet( null ) );  // illegal use
  };

  // because it throws an NPE
  assertThrownBy( code )
     .isInstanceOf( NullPointerException.class )
     .hasMessageContaining("not allowed");

=== Other AssertJ examples

[source,java]

    assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing)
       .filteredOn(character -> character.getName().contains("o"))
       .containsOnly(aragorn, frodo, legolas, boromir)
       .extracting(character -> character.getRace().getName())

=== Use Parameterized tests

* Read test data from csv files or parameter lists
* Makes writing less test

[.decentlightbg,background-video="videos/flowers.mp4",background-video-loop="true",background-opacity="0.6"]
=== Example parameterized test

[source,java]
----
    @ParameterizedTest
    @CsvSource( {
      // msg, expected, n, d
        "whole number, 2, 2, 1 ",
        "two thirds, (2/3), 2, 3",
        "one third, (1/3), -3, -9 ",
        "minus two fifths, -(2/5), 12, -30",
        "one + two fifths, -(1+(2/5)), 35, -25 "
    } )
    void t2fractionToString( String message, String expected,
                             int num, int denom ) {

        Fraction actual = new Fraction( num, denom );
        assertThat( actual.toString() )
                .as( message )
                .isEqualTo( expected );

=== Use test tooling

* Code coverage includes a view on complexity.
* Business code mutation or automatic breaking the code to check the tests

[.notes]
--
* explain McCabe's cyclomatic complexity?
** Number of independent linear paths through the code.
* show examples from Alda?
* Pitests shows how good your tests are at discovering errors.

=== Lessons from test tooling

* Coverage is not the ultimate goal, less complex is.
* Looking at coverage reports and wonder why you can't reach a branch.
* Not covered code also points at too much code, code that has not been asked by TDD.

[.notes]
--
* _Unreachable code_ (by precondition in earlier parts) is a side effect of high complexity.
Studying the coverage report (which branch is never reached) may help find a test, or, more often,
a too complex solution or branching logic in the wrong order or over constrained.
* Even if you do not care so much for high coverage, look at the complexity of methods, and see if you can
improved (decrease) complexity.

=== Lessons from code mutation

* Sometimes you get false positives. Best is to comment them, for the maintainer.

=== General observations

* Code of 'experienced' juniors is often complex.
* This complexity is often a sign of NOT working TDD.

* Student specific?
