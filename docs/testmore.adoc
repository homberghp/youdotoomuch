== Test More

* Testing is not a [red]*cost* but an [green]*investment*.
* By working TDD style you typically write [green]#less# code.
* Writing tests can help [green]#reveal inconsistencies# in requirements.
* You [green]#reduce risk# in the future.
* Having [red]#to few# tests produces a serious [red]#technical debt#.

[.notes]
--
* Studies have shown that, after some decrease at the beginning, +
  testing actually increases programmers productivity.
* In coding, _less is more_.
* Automated tests and regressions.

=== No Tests, No Progress

* You can't measure progress [green]#unless# you test.
* A test ensures that a feature is realized.

[.notes]
--
Although tests can't prove the absence of errors,
they can help measure the degree of done.

=== Tests give confidence

* Including confidence to change or experiment.

[.notes]
--
* a set of passing functional tests are a great way to enable experiments
  to improve non functional aspects such as efficiency, readability.

=== Testing Documents

* A well written test is the easiest way to document how an API +
 is to be used, including [red]*pre*- and post-conditions.

[.notes]
--
* Tests are an excellent way to document the use of an API.

=== Example

[source,java]
----
  String greet= greeter.greet( "Klaas" );
  assertThat(greet) // passes
      .isNotNull()
      .isNotEmpty()
      .contains( "Hello", "Klaas" );
----

[.notes]
--
* The test is trivial to write and exposes the function of the API.
* Example uses more asserts than needed, but is about readability.

=== Example

[source,java]
----
  ThrowingCallable code = () -> {
          greeter.greet(null));  // illegal use
  };

  // because it throws an NPE
  assertThrownBy( code )
     .isInstanceOf( NullPointerException.class );

--
* This test documents the precondition.
