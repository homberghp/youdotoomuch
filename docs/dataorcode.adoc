== Data or Code


Start with data modeling or business objects?

* as always, the answer depends on the situation.
* However, many applications are very well +
 modeled in a relational schema.
** Shops, machine part catalogs, including composite parts.
** Of the database models, the relational model prevailed.

=== Opinion/ Discussion
** (Opinion) Popularity of non-SQL database is caused by +
  too little (or out-dated) understanding of the
  RDBMS model.
** The [blue]#NO-SQL# databases are often ones with only one instance +
  (neo4j, mongodb,) with little commonality, like a query language.
** They may compromise on important properties such as ACID. +
  Look for [red]*eventually consistent*.

* an iso graph query standard GQL may be on the way.

=== Choosing the right tool.

* Choose the paradigm for the right reasons.
* Modeling network (think Facebook type relation, friends, but +
  also road routing info ) might be more natural (and performant) +
  in a graph-type database.
* There is no reason to put all data in one storage model.

=== The data model is often a one-of.

* Data models have little reuse. They are application specific.
* There are no big data patterns, other than table model, +
 and the relations, or graphs, 1-1, 1-n, or n-m, +
  where the later is often only used in two modes: +
   the *1-n* and the *m-1* mode.
* Machine parts DO have patterns, best practices, reusable libraries etc.
//* The data does not mind how it passed through a machine,

different app types.
* Machine parts a.k.a. embedded. The software is part of the actual machine. The data processed is
the sensory input to actuator output. The processing is event handling or value computation with stringent time constraints.
* The automaton model is fitting here. Patterns : observer, buffering.
* Business applications in which a majority of the code in book-keeping  a.k.a. CRUD operations. Business rules often are
things that are not an obvious computation.
