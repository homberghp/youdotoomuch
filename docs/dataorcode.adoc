=== Choosing the right tool.

* Choose the paradigm for the right reasons.
* Modeling network (think Facebook type relation, friends, but also road routing info ) might be more natural (and performant) in a graph-type database.


=== The data model is often a one-of.

* Data models have little reuse. They are application specific.
* There are no big data patterns, other than the relations, or graphs, 1-1, 1-n, or n-m,
where the later is often only used in two modes: the 1-n and them-1 mode.
* Machine parts DO have patterns, best practices, reusable libraries etc.
//* The data does not mind how it passed through a machine,
