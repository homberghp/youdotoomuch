== Teaching & Learning

Teaching is like crossing a river, going from the known to the unknown using wobbly foot rests.

[.notes]
--
* Stepping stone metaphore. Once one leg stands firm, you can test the next stone.
* There remain unknowns on the way

=== Not too much or too little

* You can't learn/teach all At Once.
* Learning is sometimes taking tiny steps.
* And accepting unknowns. Sometimes.

[.notes]
--
* Start with tiny steps. You must be able to walk before you can run.
* Allow some things to be unknown

=== Do not lead to danger

* Beware of [red]**over**[green]**simplification**.
* Avoid examples that must be [red]**un**learned.
* If some configurations can't be understood yet, [green]_provide them_.
* [strike red]*Students* [green]*Everyone* should learn to never share passwords.

[.notes]
--
* Sql injection vulnerabilities stem from bad SQL examples, combined with string concatenation.
* Make sure that the security sensitive parts of the configuration are properly set up.
* Provide the maven configuration, or simplify it (testeasypom)
* With Docker also use docker-compose, which provides an easy and secure way to supply the username
and password without having it in the source code.

=== [red]#Bad# example, DB config

* Using dbadmin (postgres, root, dba, sys) as the +
username in an application.
* Putting the/a db-username and -password +
 in the source code of an application.

=== Admin [red]*Bad*, why?

* With a typical database you introduce 3 problems:
. The source is in a repository, potentially leaking passwords.
. The admin user has too much power, can do everything.
. Using the admin user makes database rights ([blue]#GRANT#, [blue]#REVOKE#) +
  [red]*completely ineffective* +
 because the admin user is [red]*not* subject to [blue]*access rights*.

[.notes]
--
* All major rdbms have a role system with rights that can be granted or revoked.
* This is a major feature of those databases and often overlooked.
* Proper use can produce very fine grained data security, where only the owner of a record can see it.

[.lightbg,background-video="videos/river.mp4",background-video-loop="true",background-opacity="0.7"]
=== [green]#Good# example

* Provide [blue]#docker# *and* [blue]#docker-compose# configurations +
 that do security settings right.
* E.g. use a simple [blue]`.env` file that is [red]#not# committed to git. +
  This can keep sensitive info secret.
* Provide a script that can create the initial users, +
  with the appropriate rights.

[.notes]
--
* One user/password for the global db admin.
* One for the schema owner.
* At least one for the application, with trimmed (revoked) down rights.
* dockerdinges as example.
