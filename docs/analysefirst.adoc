== Think before ...

* Too often, 'experienced' developers 'see' the solution before they heard the end of the requirements.
** They think in solutions.

Even if the solution is not the answer to the problem, or even the best.

=== Deeper analysis

* Can you find analogies.
* Twist and turn the concept model, it may reveal other approaches.
* A model is a `perspective`.

=== Model (analyze) this

=== Model this too

=== Modeling/analysing is...

...Finding the proper perspective.

A typical physical artifact can be modeled as a

A tree of sub assemblies, where each sub-assembly is a list of sub-assemblies.

There is a (GoF) pattern here.

* In all the above the first models are list and tree, and as a matter of fact
 tree plus list is the most useful.
* Composite is the patterns
* If we have a tree in which each node can have a list of nodes, than with an average
of 7 children per node an three levels deep, we can express an assembly of 343 parts.
* Rules need to be made to assign sub-assemblies to levels.
* The top level is the whole duh.
* For each assembly, it can be considered as a whole and can be built independent of the other assemblies on the same level.
* No cycles in the loop.
* Leaf nodes may refer to the same type (think nuts and bolts, spokes of a wheel)
