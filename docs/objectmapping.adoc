== Object Mapping

image::images/objectmapping.jpg[]

* Object relational mapping is a popular technique to +
present database entities as first class object in the business layer.

=== Benefits of ORM

* ORM allows one to express the business logic in the OO +
  language of choice. (Java, .Net).
* OO (Java, C#) programmers are abundantly available.
* Work well when everything from the middle layer up (towards UI) +
  also uses Objects in the same technology.

(Think C# or Java-swing or JavaFX application), but also applets, when they were fashionable.

=== Drawbacks of ORM.

* let us use entities as the elements of data.
* There is a mismatch between Database relational model +
  and object model.
* across the divide, the entities have different functionality.

=== [.small-font]#raison d'Ãªtre of PoJos.#

Think Rest or GraphQL.

* A big part of many applications is plain CRUD.
* transforming to objects (from DB) and then to (say JSON) +
 shows that the objects serve no purpose, and actually only consume useless CPU cycles.

=== Do not do others work

* Never do work that someone else already does.
* Modern relational databases (as in all) can output +
 AND safely parse JSON documents.
* This means that the database can directly handle +
  the json object from the request body.
* example to the extreme: PostgREST.

"Use a collection of sharp tools rather than building a big ball of mud."

needs references
Postgrest is implemented in haskell.
* Maybe there is time for a PostgREST demo.
