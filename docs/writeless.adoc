== Write less

[quote]
What is not written can't be wrong.

One of the most surprising ideas for the student is
that we teach them write less code.

=== Think before type

* Have I done it before?
* Its there some(one|thing) else that can do it for you?
* Is there a function in the library that can do it?
* Is there functionality in a different layer, even if the paradigm is different (SQL vs OO).

[.notes]
--
* Remember sit on your hands, anyone?
* The less you write the less you err.
* Always be critical.
* A by-the-book solution might not be the best for your case.

=== Model right

* Use the proper modeling tool/technique.
* A model leaves out some details to reveal other.

[.notes]
--
* Modeling should be used to discover things, not for the modeling sake.
* Choosing the proper diagram or paradigm can de difficult, but is necessary.

=== Do not [red]*over* model

* In many applications [green]*one* data model +
 (the ER-model) suffices.
* Duplicating this into an object model (e.g. POJO) serves +
  [red]#no# purpose. Think [red]*Panko*.
* Just use a simple **D**ata **T**ransfer **O**bject, like a record in Java 14+.
* If using JSON, not even a *DTO* is required.
* Modeling inheritance in domain entities is just as [red]*useless*.
* Use composition a.k.a. [green]#views# to get the data fit for a use case.

[.notes]
--
* Do not make both a ERD/database model and a object model.
* Use one source of truth. Most of the time start with the data (sausage).
* Double models only adds complexity and work.
* Useless transformations in a layered architecture have no (business) value, only cost. Not only programming work but also CPU cycles (energy).
* Inheritance it will [red]*not survive transit*.
* The other layer may very well not support classes (JSON, sql) and inheritance. In those layers it is just data. Do not make more of it.

=== Model the machine instead

* Put the modeling effort in the machine.
* In many cases the machine can be designed using +
  [blue]*well known patterns*.
* Actually all frameworks are chock-full of patterns.
* Through patterns, libraries can provide many of the machine parts.

[.notes]
--
* Use the sausage vs machine metaphor.
* Effort can be focus on identifying the opportunities for patterns (GoF, Others) +
 Or Non Functional requirements like test-ability. (Layered design).
* Patterns or idioms can/should be taught relatively early, because they are helpful to understand API's.
* Teach patterns in small steps. Observer, Composite, Strategy/State.

. make the requirements less dumb
. try and delete part of the process/product
. simplify or optimize
. accelerate cycle time
. automate

* Musk: Do it in this order. It is not smart to throw a part out, after it has been optimized.
* Hom's translation: Use every opportunity to remove code. What's not there does not have to be maintained and can't be wrong.
