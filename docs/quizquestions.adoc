=== Immutable

* Why is immutable considered good? Name 3 reasons.


[.notes]
--
. No need to reason about possible states. There is only one, that after construction. +
  By the way a Java String is immutable, so a json document as String is too.
. Can be freely copied (think caches) without affecting or introducing caching problems. +
 (An immutable object is never written to, after instantiation) so no cache line invalidation.
. Speed.
. The first two make the functional/immutable style of functional languages so appealing.
. OO at the beginning was very state-full. Java think java beans. Now more and more functional style
  is promoted. With the combination of lambdas and streams this became even more popular.

=== What is more important

* 'Speed' of writing or ease of understanding/reading?
