topics

= testing of course
== every language support (unit) testing.
e.g. XCTest  for Swift, PHPUnit, NUnit for dotNet, many for javascript and friends.

What is not written can't be wrong.

== odd joke door.isOpen()
= The importance of reading code and readability.
"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." (Martin Fowler in Refactoring)
= didactics
== tiny steps
== use known concepts as stepping stones
== but avoid bad examples, because they lead to bad practices.
= Read more code
= Make students, teachers, and society security aware

= Didactics
= explaining everything before starting with the first line of code.
= to get working examples, you typically need concepts not yet explained.
= allow yourselves to NOT explain everything, but provide partial solution up front, in particular
configuration (maven), saying use this and ignoring questions for now. Keeping it tiny or hidden (testeasypom) is best.
= However avoid bad examples, just to circumvent an unexplained part.
== You keep you toddler away from the stove, but by explaining what hot means.
= Example System.out is a global object or type java.util.PrintStream. Do not bother what exactly it is nor what it can do, but
simply show the use in the most typical case. Otherwise you couldn't write Hello world in java without spending 6 lessons in advance.
= Same for java.util.scanner and argv.
== However, revisit earlier examples to explain concepts when it is the time.

= Test driven teaching
= Test code provides excellent examples on how to use an API, shows do's and don'ts (e.g. when exceptions are thrown)
= Test code should be easy to read (understand) and easy to write.
== assertThat( helloString ).isNotEmpty().contains( "Hello" );


= bad examples
== building sql queries with string concatenation.
== Using dbadmin (postgres) as the username in an application.
== Having the/a username and password in the source code of an application.
=== When using e.g. postgress, you introduce 3 problems.
1. The source is typically in a repository, which leaks the password to places where it is not needed.
2. Postgres as user has too much power. It controls all databases on a server.
3. Using progress as application user make databases rights (GRANT, REVOKE) completely ineffective, because
the postgres user (user id 1) is not subject to access rules

= Show bad examples only for their badness, as war stories, never as an alternate truth. (fake news).


= best practices
= always be critical. A by-the-book solution might not be the best for your case.
= shifting paradigm or layer, or use another (already present) layer to do the work may make it less and or simpler.
= Writing the whole application in Java is not the holy grail. Writing less code is.
== Of many applications, 90 to 95 % of the operations is CRUD. Most of it (including translating to and from json) can be done by the database.
== The database will kindly produce a json result, if nicely asked.
== the middle-ware's role is reduced to transforming to and from formats the database can't provide, but be aware of
useless transformations, e.g. from db to pojo to json if the database can do json already. If the front end consumes json, then have the database produce it.
== if a lot is done in the database layer, choosing another language for middle-ware of front-end becomes trivial.

= TIPS to simplify programmatic database interaction.
= Database specific: On insert, update, and delete always end with RETURNING, e.g. RETURNING *
== Yes, ignore the plethora of ways to deal with different statement styles. One suffices (jdbc: stmt.executeQuery()).
== Then processing all statements (select, insert, update, and delete) have the same form and return the same kind of result.
== Always expect a list type result ([] in json), so not found is an empty list, and does not need special treatment.
== Exceptions indicate either rights problems or statement syntax problems, which could and should have been tested in advance.
== Extract (complex) SQL statements from the method bodies and put them somewhere where they are testable, like in final package private fields.
=== You can test sql statements for java (assertJ-DB).
//== Use setObject(int, Object) to set values, there is no need to be more type specific, so you can do it in a loop for all parameters.
// This is a big help to avoid copy and waste boilerplate.

= TIPS for PHP database programming.
== Always use a function (method) that takes the request parameters and produces the result values to be used in rendering the page.
== The function returns an array of response values.
== This makes the processing testable (by calling said function in the test).
== use the setObject (stmt->execute([....])) equivalent to process the parameters to a prepared statement.
  This is much shorter to write (for loop) and avoids copy and waste ceremonies.

= NEVER EVER share passwords.
= Put your local passwords in a local, uncommitted file, so keeping it to your self.
== file should be small and simple to understand and maintain, e.g. a properties file.
= with docker, include docker-compose to start your container. This eases correct container configuration (.env == uncommitted file )
= a docker-compose file typically simpler that the Docker files describing the images.
== Get students in the habit of working this way, so they avoid that issue naturaly in real practice.
== add a user that owns the database, with full (grant) rights to that databases
== add an application-user whose rights on database objects are trimmed down to the essential.
= use modern sql constructs, avoid complexity (complex queries) when not needed.
== common table expressions (CTE) are a sql standard and allow declarative programming.

= 'Teachers' should be well versed in the application language and framework. A pet project
or better still a real production-use application (which will always be in beta) is best to keeping your skills up.
= The best pet project in this regard are the ones used within the team, with a team effort to maintain it.
= Maybe plan the effort for the pet project.
= Make it multi-paradigm (sql, java, javascript, dotnet, ...), but with a good distribution of functionality.
= Let it grow over time, maintain it with modern techniques. (back-end front-end, middle-ware if needed).
= If used for real production, make sure you have a proper backup regime.
= It will make you a better consultant, which is what a teacher really is or should be.

= TIPS to keep up as teacher:
== Read you literature, follow development of various languages and frameworks (java, dot net, javascript).
== Regularly update your (best) practice list.
== Have mature students (sem 7) investigate new language of framework features, including creating code examples
  and exercises. Some of it will be usable in the earlier semesters
//  (examples from history: JavaFX, maven, docker, BPMN, mongodb, jenkins, OAUTH, restassured, resteasy,
//  spring-boot, MQTT, jhipster, graalvm, quarkus, graphQL, kafka, keycloack)
== Use the internship leverage: your 2 hours of input produces 10 hours worth of your own work, and keeps the student busy for 2 to 3 times as much.
== ESD is there for you too, teacher, use it.
== A pet project could be started with a Sofa, but make sure you are in the loop.
== Make sure there is budget for these pet project, maybe call them research or production projects.

= TIPS for managers
== Remember the main task of teaching: making and keeping motivation up. One can't fake one's own motivation.
== Facilitate the teachers to do their pet projects and stimulate that. Practice maketh professional.
== Remember that studying is work, also if you are a teacher.
== Do not pay for hours in plan but for tasks accomplished. Find a proper value/pay key for tasks, and a proper definition of done.
== The quality times quantity model. The area is more or less constant per person, but may differ between them. The area is the product with value.
== Do not count/pay presence hours but product accomplished and customer (student) satisfaction (more or less quality).

Final remark to all educators and pedagogues

It is always more satisfying to win a hard battle than a trivial one.
Trivial battles do not motivate.
